XPath 1.0 reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/

TBD:
  - which axes are supported? (differences with XPath spec?)
    (note: fields in protos are not completely ordered; should I order them
           according to definition order in proto?)
  - which node types?
  - which built-in functions? (differences with XPath spec?)
  - can I match text-only protos without a definition? (This changes the
    definition of document-order. Requires text parsing.)

TODO:
  - create testcases for examples listed
